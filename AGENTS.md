## Project Overview

QBC Workboard is a responsive Scrum workspace for planning and delivering
software, product, and AI consulting work: initiatives, epics, stories, tasks,
assistants and their logged hours, backlog grooming, two-week sprint planning,
and active-sprint execution. The ASP.NET Core API (Clean Architecture, MediatR,
EF Core on SQL Server) and the Angular app publish as one deployable output. The
deployment is gated by a single shared passcode, not user accounts.

- `backend/` — .NET solution (`Qbc.Workboard.Domain`, `.Application`,
  `.Infrastructure`, `.Api`, `.Cli`) and its tests
- `frontend/` — Angular workspace (`qbc-workboard` app, `api` clients,
  `components` UI library)
- `e2e/` — Playwright browser acceptance suite for the frontend (its own npm
  package, run with `npm test` after building `frontend/`)
- `docs/specs/` — L1/L2 requirements; `docs/detailed-designs/` — per-feature
  designs; `docs/mocks/` — static design reference

See `README.md` for setup and development commands.

## Frontend conventions

- Prettier (`frontend/.prettierrc.json`) owns formatting and angular-eslint (`frontend/eslint.config.js`) owns lint; CI fails on either. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` in `frontend/`. The husky pre-commit hook fixes staged frontend files.

- ## Scope, Simplicity, and Zero-Waste Engineering (CRITICAL)

This is the absolute highest-priority rule in this repository. AI agents tend to over-engineer, hallucinate future needs, and balloon codebase complexity. This kills project velocity and comprehensibility. You must resist this impulse. Deliver radically simple solutions that fulfill the exact prompt—nothing more.

### 1. Absolute Scope Lock
*   **Deliver Only the Explicit Request:** Implement exactly what is asked for in the immediate task. Do not invent features, add unrequested states, create predictive API endpoints, or spin up new UI screens/components unless explicitly ordered.
*   **Zero Future-Proofing:** Do not write code for "imagined future use cases." Write code strictly for the present moment. If the user didn't ask for it today, it does not exist.
*   **Ignore Unsent Requirements:** Documents, specs, or mocks may contain broader context or future phases. Do not implement them early. Only implement what is requested in the active prompt.

### 2. Radical Simplicity & Proportionality
*   **Proportional Diffs:** The size and footprint of your code change must match the size of the request. A small feature or fix must result in a small, clean, readable diff.
*   **Path of Least Resistance:** Always choose the simplest, most direct code path that solves the problem. Do not introduce new abstractions, architectural layers, design patterns, wrappers, or external libraries unless it is physically impossible to solve the issue without them.
*   **No Unsolicited Refactoring:** Do not "improve," rewrite, or clean up code adjacent to your task unless it is strictly broken and blocking your implementation. Leave surrounding code alone.

### 3. Hard Stop & Query Clause
*   **When in Doubt, Ask:** If a task seems to logically require expanding the scope, introduces a major jump in complexity, or conflicts with the existing architecture, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**. Do not guess. Present the trade-offs to the user and await explicit confirmation before writing a single line of code.


## Incremental Implementation and ATDD - mandatory

Mocks and the design system are design artifacts. ATDD does not apply to their
development. Do not write tests for mocks or the design system.

Every new feature or change to production behavior MUST have a requirement, a
detailed design, and a mock before implementation begins. This includes
behavioral changes to existing features, such as changing how a page behaves.
This requirement applies to production-code changes only; documentation-only,
design-system-only, mock-only, and test-only changes are out of scope unless
they are part of implementing a production behavior change.

Every production behavior implementation MUST invoke and follow the
`incremental-implementation` skill (`.claude/skills/incremental-implementation`
and `.agents/skills/incremental-implementation`) before any code is written,
combined with acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). Plan small,
reviewable slices, then complete one slice at a time: write Given-When-Then
acceptance criteria, write the acceptance test, and run it to prove it fails for
the expected reason BEFORE writing production code. Implement only what satisfies
that slice, refactor with tests green, and run the relevant regression checks.
Do not move to the next slice until those checks pass. No bulk implementation,
no tests added afterward, and no weakening tests to manufacture a pass. Keep
the requirement, detailed design, mock, criteria, tests, and implementation
aligned until the entire feature or behavior change is complete.

Back end: integration tests against the API. Front end: Playwright in `e2e/`,
using the Page Object Model - one page object per screen, owning the selectors and the
interactions. Tests state intent; page objects know the DOM. Never put a
selector in a test.

Run frontend tests in Chromium only. Do not configure or run Firefox, WebKit,
or any other browser for frontend testing.

### Never write architecture tests

Never add a test that asserts the shape of the codebase rather than its behavior:
no structure, layout, or naming tests; no banned-API scans; no traceability tests
that parse the specifications. Those constraints belong to the compiler, the
formatter, and review. A test suite exists to prove behavior.
